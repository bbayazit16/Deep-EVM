This repository is still in the works! I'll be gradually adding more content. You are welcome to open pull requests for typos/grammar or any trick you know or for literally anything.

The aim of this repository is to explain gas optimizations, Solidity, Assembly, Bytecode, and the EVM. All you need to know to understand is some Solidity.
